This repository includes designs for the peer-to-peer commons (a.k.a. :pear:-to-:pear: commons). These are free to reuse under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication. The pear emoji in the designs is based on the Mozilla [`fxemoji`](https://github.com/mozilla/fxemoji) repository, which contains permissively licensed emoji designs.
